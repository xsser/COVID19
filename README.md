## Understand COVID-19

**Main symptoms**
People infected with the virus will have symptoms of varying degrees, some with fever or mild cough, some with pneumonia, some with even more serious or even death.
The lethality of the virus is about 2% to 4%, but this is a very early percentage that may change as more information is available. At the same time, this doesn't mean it's not serious, just that people infected with the virus don't have to face the most serious consequences.
**Route of transmission**
Novel coronavirus is the main way of transmission and respiratory droplet transmission and contact transmission, aerosol and fecal oral transmission route needs to be further clarified. According to the epidemiological investigation, the cases can be traced to the cases that have close contact with the confirmed cases.
- 1.Direct propagation
It refers to the infection caused by sneezing, coughing and speaking droplets of the patient, and the exhaled gas is inhaled directly in short distance;
- 2.aerosol transmission
It refers to the mixture of droplets in the air to form aerosol, which causes infection after inhalation;
- 3.Contact transmission
It refers to the droplets deposited on the surface of the object, after touching the contaminated hand, then touching the oral cavity, nasal cavity, eyes and other mucous membranes, leading to infection.

**Susceptible population**
People of all ages are likely to be infected, mainly adults, the elderly and the frail and sickly seem to be more likely to be infected. There is no evidence that pets such as dogs and cats can be infected.
The novel coronavirus is susceptible to pneumonia in children and pregnant women.

## Is there a specific medicine?

NO,Other drugs can only reduce RNA replication,Other drugs can only reduce RNA replication, but they can't cure you 100%
## How do I prevent
1. Reserve N95 masks (the filtering effect of N95 masks is good). In the early stage of the epidemic, the number of people infected is large, and the concentration of virus is also large. N95 masks are relatively safe. You must wear masks every time you go out! You must wear masks! The probability of being infected without masks is very high!

2. Store disinfectant, go home and disinfect the whole body (especially the sole, because the sole will step on phlegm, urine, etc.), and disinfect a series of frequently contacted things such as mobile phones, door handles, switches, etc
3. Reserve food! The food looting is not only in China, but also in Hong Kong, Singapore, Italy, South Korea and other countries and regions. The food reserve is enough for 1-2 months. Because the Chinese government forbids everyone to go out. (this reason is very complicated, but I think it is very effective and who also suggests it.)

## Core recommendations
1. Avoid contact with anyone, because you look at the person who feels healthy. He may have been infected a week ago, but he hasn't got sick yet. Of course, you should keep away from anyone who has a cough and fever. Although that's not very polite, if you are infected, you should know that you are responsible for the people near you. Otherwise, the virus will continue to spread because of your ignorance! This is reflected incisively and vividly in South Korea!
The safety of others is based on your safety. Please be responsible for yourself and the people around you! It's not about one person!
2. The most dangerous place: elevator lobby!
Avoid going to the elevator lobby if you want to! Wear goggles and mask, wash hands or disinfect after pressing the button
3. Avoid going to restaurants
4. Avoid going to the Office
5. Avoid toilets
If you want to go, please follow the advice below
Recommendation:
- 1. There are steps to go to the toilet, and they should be completed in order.
- 2. Before flushing the toilet, make sure to cover the toilet cover, so as to avoid the splashing of droplets carrying virus.
- 3. Before opening the exhaust fan of the toilet, it is necessary to open the doors and windows to avoid the formation of negative pressure backflow droplets in the sewage pipe or exhaust duct, otherwise, the virus droplets will not only invade the toilet, but also cause the virus to fill the whole toilet due to the closed space.
6. Disinfect the mobile phone
7. Wash hands frequently! Wash your hands frequently! Wash your hands frequently!
Recommendation:
- 1. Wash your hands as soon as you arrive
- 2. Wash your hands before eating
- 3. I've been to the elevator lobby and the high-risk area of the dining hall. I'll wash my hands when I come back
- 4. Wash your hands when you come back
- 5. Wash your hands before touching your face, especially your nostrils and eyes.

## How do we get food? In China
In China, we have a lot of online shopping apps. During this period, they launched a door-to-door delivery service. We placed an order through the app, and then went to the gate of the community to get it, because the Chinese government does not allow us to leave the community, and no one else can enter the community.
## How do you work in China?
As long as it's not an important industry, such as mask industry and transportation industry, we all work online, communicate through social software, or email
##What is the purpose of 14 days of medical observation?
It is necessary to take strict medical observation and other preventive public health measures for close contacts, which is a responsible attitude to public health and safety, and also a common practice of the international community.
Referring to the other novel coronavirus cases, the coronavirus case information and the current prevention and control practice, the medical observation period of the close contacts was set to 14 days, and the close contacts were observed at home.
##How long can the new coronavirus survive without human body?
Virus is different from bacteria. It is a kind of microorganism without metabolism and replication function. Therefore, all viruses are easy to deform or inactivate after leaving the host.
According to the analysis of relevant data, the survival time of the new coronavirus in the dry and ventilated environment is less than 2 hours. However, the similarity between the new coronavirus and SARS is great. According to the survival time of the surface of SARS related in vitro articles, even if the community disinfection is in place, the virus may also survive in the handle, elevator, stairs and other places.
(in the confirmed case of Inner Mongolia, Bai, 40 years old, from Dalate County, Ordos City, lives on the upper floor of the confirmed case, song. He has no history of going out of the city, has no contact with fever patients, has not been to the farmer's market, and has no contact with wild animals. It was diagnosed on February 1. It can be seen from this case that the mode of transmission of the virus may not be limited to oral foam transmission, and the risk of contact transmission increases.)
##How to prevent novel coronavirus pneumonia
A. Cherish life and keep away from game;
B. If not necessary, do not go out, do not visit, home "self isolation"; do not go to many places, do not gather;
C. Keep hands clean. Wash your hands with alcohol containing hand sanitizer at home. Hand washing can defeat most viruses and bacteria;
D. When coughing or sneezing, cover the nose and mouth with disposable tissue or sleeve, and wash hands;
E. Cook meat, eggs and other foods thoroughly, disinfect the dishes and chopsticks with high temperature boiling water;
F. Avoid close contact with patients with respiratory tract infection;
G. Wear a mask, lucky star.

## New coronavirus 16 Q 16 A


Important tips for epidemic prevention
One is the button, door handle, manual faucet and public telephone of the elevator. These places are the places where people contact frequently and frequently. They are the places where we need to disinfect.
Novel coronavirus is mainly respiratory tract, and two is air disinfection. If disinfectant is used to disinfect the air, it must be in an unmanned environment. Because if a person inhales disinfectant, or repeatedly sprays disinfectant on a person, there is a potential risk, and this risk cannot be quantitatively assessed, so it should be avoided as much as possible.
1. How long can the new coronavirus survive in the general environment?
A: the virus can only live in the cells of the organism, and it can hardly survive at room temperature.
2. Experts said that the virus was inactivated in 56 ℃ water for 30 minutes. Open water at 100 ℃, how long is it inactivated?
A: the virus only survives in animals, but not in vitro, so the articles do not need to be cooked.
3. How long can the virus survive when it leaves the human body on daily items such as doorknobs and mobile phones? If the virus leaves the living body, will the low temperature of minus 10 degrees in the North die?
A: the virus is not spread in the digestive tract. If you touch the doorknob or mobile phone, you can't pick your nose or your eyes. The virus can't survive without human body.
4. There are 84 disinfectants and alcohol at home. How can I use them?
A: 84 disinfectant and alcohol have killing effect on most bacteria and other microorganisms, but the virus can't survive without human body, so it's of little significance to use 84 disinfectant, alcohol and other disinfectants to wipe the ground.
5. Will this virus infect cats and dogs?
A: not found at present.
6. In addition to wearing masks when going out, should disposable gloves be worn?
A: no need. Wear gloves if you are afraid of cold. It's more important to wash your hands.
7. If you go out, can you wear more common medical masks sold by drugstores to improve the protection?
A: No. Outdoor activity single floor is enough.
8. How far is it safe to talk to strangers? If you don't talk to strangers, will passing by on the road infect you?
A: distance is one thing, but it's important not to sneeze or cough at people.
9. Can you eat raw vegetables? Like salads.
A: the new coronavirus is not transmitted through the digestive tract. You can eat salad.
10. Hardly go out, no cases have been found nearby. Can I wear ordinary disposable masks?
A: Yes.
11. Do you have any symptoms during the incubation period? Is incubation contagious?
A: the shortest is 1-2 days, the longest is 10-12 days, and the average is 7 days. The medical observation was 14 days. There is a certain infectivity in the incubation period. When the patient has high fever, it is the most infectious.
12. How is the symptom difference between new crown infection and common cold?
A: new crown infection mainly has fever, local respiratory symptoms are usually not serious, some people will have serious dyspnea or systemic damage. These are the biggest differences from the common cold.
13. Is there any specific medicine at present?
A: not yet. The treatment principle is mainly symptomatic and supportive.
14. What are the characteristics of those who can heal themselves? What are the characteristics of people who died of serious illness?
Answer: self-healing is related to physical fitness, mostly for people with sound immune function. Most of the patients who died of serious illness were old people and basic patients.
15. Is it possible to cure the discharged patients with secondary infection? How to care after recovery?
A: I don't think so at present, because there are antibodies. How to recover depends on the patient's recovery.
16. Are common cold drugs or antibiotics effective for the virus?
Answer: no effect.

##Zhong Nanshan's latest answer to the new coronavirus!

A novel coronavirus was recently released in February 18th in Guangdong province to announce the latest progress in the treatment of new coronavirus. Zhong Nanshan, director of national respiratory disease clinical medicine research center and academician of Chinese Academy of engineering, attended the meeting. Zhong Nanshan said that at present, chloroquine phosphate recommended by experts is not a specific drug, but it has some help and is very worthy of discussion.
Academician Zhong Nanshan thought that the "plasma treatment" method which had been talked about before was relatively old, but it was more effective, more worthy of affirmation and safer. But at the same time, it should be noted that the source of plasma therapy is still limited.
For the mortality of 2019 ncov, Zhong Nanshan thinks that the mortality of 2019 ncov in the new coronavirus (SARS, mers and 2019 ncov) is relatively low.
Zhong Nanshan's latest answer to the new coronavirus!
1. Is chloroquine phosphate a specific drug?
Zhong Nanshan: if you want to ask if chloroquine phosphate is a specific drug, I don't think it's enough, but it's worth exploring. Chloroquine phosphate is effective against coronavirus, and it is used in human body this time.
Chloroquine phosphate is an old drug, which has no side effect in short term. It has been used in Beijing and Guangdong at the same time. Within 4-5 days, the virus has turned negative. Now, a large clinical observation is being carried out.
But whether it's a specific drug is not enough. It's helpful from the current situation.
2. How to treat unconventional cases? Is the current kit accurate?
Zhong Nanshan: about the incubation period. For example, we published 1099 articles, with an average incubation period of 4 days, and 2-7 days is the majority. But we also wrote faithfully for 0-24 days. 24 days was one in 1099. There are 13 cases over 14 days, and most of them also need to consider special circumstances. I don't think it's strange. There are always exceptions.
The method of nucleic acid test reagent itself is correct, but it depends on the material.
3. Fast kit problem?
Zhong Nanshan: Wuhan is the key. 80% of the patients are in Wuhan. It seems that Wuhan has not stopped human to human transmission. Now we need to solve two problems closely: how to separate normal people from patients and how to separate influenza virus from new coronavirus. If we always mix up, Wuhan has used a lot of human and financial resources, and this problem still cannot be solved.
So we strongly hope to strengthen the reagent, and we hope to distinguish the new crown or influenza soon. Now that the technology is available, the R &amp; D is available, we will wait for approval.
Supplementary information: Recently, under the guidance of academician Zhong Nanshan, a rapid test kit was developed. Only one drop of blood can be collected for 15 minutes to obtain the test results, and the positive bands can still be detected after the patient's plasma is diluted 500 to 1000 times.
4. The role of traditional Chinese medicine in new coronavirus?
Zhong Nanshan: Western Medicine found in the laboratory that cell level is effective for the new crown, but quite a lot of Western medicine is ineffective after entering the human body. Novel coronavirus pneumonia has been used in clinical treatment of new crown pneumonia. I am concerned about whether the use of Chinese medicine can reduce the virus entry into cells and reduce inflammation.
I attach great importance to the role of traditional Chinese medicine. Once there is evidence, traditional Chinese medicine can be used at ease. Especially in the early and middle stage.
5. How to evaluate the treatment of plasma in rehabilitation patients?
Zhong Nanshan: the plasma of convalescent patients was first used in China in 2005, when it was H5N1 infection. H5N1 had a high mortality rate, when miraculous viremia disappeared; by 2009, Hong Kong compatriots had done so, and it was found that there was a significant difference between the use of recovered patients' plasma and the non use.
As far as I know, I did this in Wuhan Institute of biological products. Some patients are very willing to contribute this blood, but the production process is still needed. Now we have done 10 cases, and 6 cases have gone viral after medication. Guangdong is also going to adopt this method, mainly for serious patients, not dying patients, which looks promising.
The old method is more effective, certain and safe. Sources are limited, but I think it's effective, especially for severe patients, not critically ill patients.
6. At present, severe patients and nosocomial infection are more concerned. What is the cure rate of severe patients in Guangdong, and what is the good experience to share?
Zhong Nanshan: about 85% of patients can be improved if they have good life support, treatment conditions and nutrition.
There are not many serious patients discharged from hospital, but 50% of them transferred from ICU to general ward. The effect of severe treatment is good.
The mortality rate of 2019-ncov is a little more than 2%. Among the three new coronaviruses (the first is SARS, the second is mers, and the third is 2019-ncov), the mortality rate of 2019-ncov is relatively low.
7. How to prevent nosocomial infection?
Zhong Nanshan: the problem of nosocomial infection is very important. Wuhan hospital is now very good, but it has become an important place for infection for some time before. At present, there are few medical people infected in other cities, because the protection is well done.
Sewers in toilets are usually of great importance. It's usually important to keep it. Like other foreign experts, I don't think it's an infection of the digestive tract. It's a dry stool. It's infected by air. This is the most reasonable explanation.
